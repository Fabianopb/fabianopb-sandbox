      'As part of a project during a course in Aalto University we worked in a team of four developers to create an Android app that could run heavy desktop applications.<br><br>This was achieved using <a href="https://cloud.google.com" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a>. In this project, OpenOffice and Inkscape instances were created in Google Cloud.<br><br>The backend, done mainly in Python, and also running as an instance in the cloud, was responsible to authorize a user to login into the application, return the list of available instances in the cloud, and start and stop the instances as requested by the user.<br><br>The Android app itself, works with several async tasks to sending http requests to authenticate, get the list of apps, and start and stop the instances. When starting an instance, the front-end receives a public IP and can then connect via VNC to the remote application running in the cloud. For making this possible, we have embedded the <a href="https://github.com/bk138/multivnc" target="_blank">MultiVNC</a> inside our own. Pretty nifty!',

      'Yes, in Tokyo! During the last weekend of April 2017 I participated in <a href="http://tokyo.hackjunction.com/" target="_blank">Tokyo Junction Hackathon</a>.<br><br>Starting with the challenge of "How can we change the way people work?" we have used <a href="https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/cool-robots/pepper" target="_blank">Pepper</a>, the friendly robot from SoftBank to create the office buddy.<br><br>The fully implemented feature during that weekend was booking meetings with voice command. By saying for example "Buddy, I want to have a meeting with Jake on May 5 from 11 to 12", Pepper would record the voice, send to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html" target="_blank">IBM Watson\'s speech to text API</a>, and the output would be parsed in a series of scripts on <a href="https://nodered.org/" target="_blank">Node-RED</a> to become an HTTP request to our backend, which would create the appointment in the database and send that information via websocket to update our user interface done in <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a> in real-time. Oh, and both backend and frontend were hosted in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/" target="_blank">Bluemix</a> nicely configured to build and deploy when pushing to Github.<br><br>It was fun, exhausting, and mind-blowing, to be in a Hackathon in Japan with amazing people developing unimaginable things in such a short time.<br><br>Some more info on the project on <a href="https://devpost.com/software/theworkbuddy" target="_blank">Devpost</a><br><br>The UI source code on <a href="https://github.com/Fabianopb/work-buddy" target="_blank">my Github</a>.<br><br>Pictures and video credit to Junction Hackathon team.',
